Mobius is a visual programming environment for 3D modelling that combines graph-based programming (nodes and wires) with block-based programming. Each node in the graph contains a procedure that is defined by sequence of blocks. 

The Mobius interface consists of a main output window on the left, a dataflow graph window on the bottom right, and a parameter window is on the top right. The graph consists of a network of connected nodes. New nodes can be created by double-clicking on the graph window area. Selecting a node will show its parameters in the parameter window. Double-clicking the node will open up the procedure window that allows the underlying procedure for the node to be edited. 

Three types of blocks that can be added: add function, add control, and add variable. Functions are define a library module, and can perform any action. Blocks can be repositioned by dragging and deleted by clicking the x.
 
Once the graph and blocks have been created, the graph can be executed by clicking the Run button. This will generate the Javascript code and then execute it, and the result of this execution will be display in the central panes.
